"Dear Professor,
When I tried to study on Lab#4 I couldn't pass the step "create new application".
Heroku web site request me a payment method.
Actually  I don't have a credit card which I can define as a payment method.
How can I add a new application without defining a credit card.

Regards,
Ali Istanbullu - 100905755"

Your response
"Hi Ali, 
try to do what you can do and no worries"
